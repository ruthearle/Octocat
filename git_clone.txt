What is Git Clone?

When repositiories are created they have specific address. When
a developer would like to have the files within the repository on their local
machine they have to download the files. This is where Git clone comes
into action.

By taking the address of the repository and passing it to the command
'git clone' a developer can download all files related to the
repository. In addition to having the files locally this command also
initialises the repository locally and allows the developer to start
commiting and pushing code immediately.
